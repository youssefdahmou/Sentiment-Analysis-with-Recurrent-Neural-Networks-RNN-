# Sentiment Analysis with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of sentiment analysis using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral. RNNs are a type of neural network architecture particularly well-suited for sequence data, making them a powerful tool for sentiment analysis tasks.

## Features
- **RNN Model:** Implement a recurrent neural network for sentiment analysis.
- **Dataset:** Utilize a suitable dataset for training and testing the sentiment analysis model(***data/IMDB Dataset.csv***).
- **Training:** Train the RNN model on the dataset to learn sentiment patterns.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on test data and analyze results.
